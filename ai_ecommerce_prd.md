# Product Requirements Document — AI-Powered E-Commerce Website (MERN)

Based on the YouTube tutorial **“Build AI Powered E-Commerce Website with MERN STACK”** and standard MERN + AI best practices, here’s a practical, implementation-ready PRD you can use to plan, build and test the project.  

---

## 1. Project Summary / Elevator Pitch

Build a production-capable e-commerce web application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) augmented with AI features (personalized recommendations, natural-language product search/assistant, image tagging and smart product categorization). The site includes customer flows, secure auth, payments, admin dashboards, and basic analytics.

**Primary Goals:**

- Fast product discovery and conversion with AI enhancements.
- Robust full-stack architecture suitable for scaling.
- Developer-friendly structure for students or teams to extend.

---

## 2. Target Users & Personas

- **Buyer (Customer)** — browses catalog, search, read reviews, purchase, track orders.
- **Seller / Merchandiser** — manages product listings, inventory, pricing.
- **Admin / Ops** — user management, order oversight, analytics, site configuration.
- **Developer / Integrator** — needs clear code structure, APIs, and documentation.

---

## 3. Scope — Core Features (MVP)

### User / Customer

- User signup / login (email/password + Google OAuth)
- Email verification and password reset flows
- Product catalog (categories, filters, pagination)
- Product detail page (images, specs, reviews)
- Cart and checkout flow with payment integration (Razorpay / Stripe)
- Order history and tracking
- Ratings & reviews

### AI Features (MVP)

- Personalized recommendations on homepage and PDP (item-based collaborative / content-based)
- Natural language search — user queries like “red running shoes under $100”
- Lightweight conversational assistant (chatbox) for product help

### Admin / Seller

- Admin dashboard (product CRUD, order management, users)
- Simple analytics (sales, top products, conversion)

---

## 4. Nice-to-Have (Post-MVP)

- Image recognition for auto-tagging product images
- Dynamic pricing / promotions engine
- Multi-vendor marketplace features
- A/B testing for recommendations
- Real-time notifications via websockets

---

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** P95 page load < 1.2s; API responses < 200ms
- **Scalability:** Stateless backend + MongoDB replica set; caching for recommendations (Redis)
- **Security:** JWT access + refresh tokens, HTTPS, input validation, rate limiting
- **Maintainability:** Clean service/controller pattern; well-documented APIs
- **Observability:** Logs, error tracking, simple metrics (requests, errors, orders)

---

## 6. Tech Stack & Third-Party Services

- **Frontend:** React (CRA or Vite), React Router, Redux / RTK Query
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express
- **DB:** MongoDB (Atlas / self-hosted)
- **Auth:** JWT (access + refresh), Google OAuth
- **Payments:** Razorpay or Stripe
- **AI Services:** OpenAI / embeddings, vector DB for search
- **Caching & Session:** Redis
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions; Vercel/Netlify (frontend), Heroku / Render / DigitalOcean / AWS ECS (backend)

---

## 7. Data Models (High Level)

### User
```json
{
  "_id": "...",
  "username": "string",
  "email": "string",
  "passwordHash": "string",
  "role": "customer|seller|admin",
  "isEmailVerified": true,
  "refreshToken": "string",
  "addresses": [ {...} ],
  "wishlist": ["productId"]
}
```

### Product
```json
{
  "_id":"...",
  "title":"string",
  "description":"string",
  "price": number,
  "currency":"INR|USD",
  "images":[ "url" ],
  "category":"string",
  "tags":[ "running","red" ],
  "stock": number,
  "metadata": { ... }
}
```

### Order
```json
{
  "_id":"...",
  "userId":"...",
  "items":[ { "productId":"...", "qty":1, "price":100 } ],
  "status":"created|paid|shipped|delivered|cancelled",
  "paymentInfo": { ... }
}
```

### Recommendation Vectors
```json
{
  "productId":"...",
  "vector": [0.12, ...],
  "lastUpdated": 169...
}
```

## 8. API Surface (Examples)

- `POST /api/auth/register` — register (returns access+refresh)
- `POST /api/auth/login` — login
- `GET /api/products` — list (filters, q, sort, page)
- `GET /api/products/:id` — product detail
- `POST /api/cart` — add item
- `POST /api/checkout` — create order & payment intent
- `GET /api/recommendations?userId=...` — personalized items
- `POST /api/search` — natural language search (`{ q: "..." }`)

---

## 9. AI Architecture (Practical Choices)

- **Search:** Embed product text → vector search → rank results
- **Recommendations:** Hybrid collaborative/content-based → cache per user
- **Chat Assistant:** RAG: retrieve relevant product docs → LLM generates answer
- **Auto-tagging:** Image recognition / API suggestion of tags

Start with managed AI (OpenAI) for prototyping → later self-hosted if needed.

---

## 10. Security & Privacy

- Password hashes (bcrypt / argon2)
- HTTPS required
- Secure JWT usage (short-lived access + refresh rotation)
- Input validation & sanitization
- Minimal payment card data stored
- GDPR / consent compliance

---

## 11. Metrics & Success Criteria

- MVP: user can register/login, browse catalog, purchase, AI search works
- KPIs: checkout rate, search→view conversion, API error rate <1%, search <300ms
- Reliability: 99% availability in dev testing

---

## 12. Milestones (12–14 Week Example Plan)

- Week 0: Project setup, repo, CI, DB
- Week 1–2: Auth system + admin skeleton
- Week 3–4: Product model + listing + frontend pages
- Week 5: Cart + checkout + payment
- Week 6–7: Admin CRUD + order management + email flows
- Week 8–9: Simple recommendations + caching
- Week 10: Natural language search
- Week 11: Chat assistant integration
- Week 12: Testing, security hardening, deployment
- Buffer / polish: +2 weeks

---

## 13. Deliverables

- Git repo with README
- Working frontend & backend deployed staging environment
- Postman collection for auth → product → checkout → AI search
- Admin dashboard (products & orders)
- Basic analytics (sales, top products)
- Documentation: architecture, API docs, deployment steps

---

## 14. Testing Plan

- Unit tests for controllers & AI mocks
- Integration tests for checkout & payment
- E2E tests: register → buy
- Load test for search & recommendations

---

## 15. Risks & Mitigation

- AI cost & latency — small models, cache embeddings/results
- Payment complexity — sandbox testing, PCI guidance
- Data consistency — optimistic updates, transactions if needed

---

## 16. UI/UX Notes

- **Home:** hero + recommended products + trending
- **Category/List:** filters, sorting, quick add to cart
- **Product Page:** images, review section, similar items
- **Checkout:** guest checkout allowed; one-page preferred
- **Search:** single input, autocomplete suggestions using AI

---

## 17. Next Steps

I can:

- Produce detailed OpenAPI spec
- Generate Mongoose data schemas
- Build Postman collection for full user flow
- Create implementation roadmap split into sprints
